# Apocalypse Tomorrow
**Introduction**

This is a 3D first-person shooter & horror game. It is one of the first "bigger" games I made in my game dev journey and it was used as a way to delve deeper into the FPS and horror genres. The main inspiration for this game was the Left 4 Dead series. In the game you fight against small but also big groups of zombies while trying to survive and escape.

## Specifics
*Gameplay*

The game is set in an alternate reality where, after a global conflict between world powers, zombies have inexplicably appeared. The player is placed in the role of the sole survivor in a small town in Nevada, USA. 

His objective is to defeat the other unfortunate inhabitants of that town by any means necessary and ensure his own salvation.
